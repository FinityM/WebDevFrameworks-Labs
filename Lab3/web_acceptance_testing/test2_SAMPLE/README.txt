HINTS (general):

    - populate /vendor by running 'composer update'

    - run the web server with 'composer serve'

        - and use another terminal window to run tests while that server is running

    - run all tests with 'composer web'

    - run 1 set of tests with 'composer web1' (replace 1 with 2, 3)

    - run tests with detailed steps with 'composer websteps', 'composer web1steps', 'composer web2steps', and so on

    - you'll find the web test classes in '/tests/acceptance'
